"Let's Ruin the Holidays!!!"

## Concept:
Intro page declares "Let's ruin the Holidays!!!" with brief instructions and allows said user to input a name and age.

First page of actual game shows 3 values:
(Make Money Button) A full metric bar that slowly decreases overtime, but increases each time the user pushes the "Make that Money!!! $$$" button. Representing money in bank account.
(Donate to Charity Button) Another full metric bar that slowly decreases overtime, but increases each time user pushes the "Donate to Charity" button. Representing dontations made to charity.
---- If either of these values hits 0, user loses and is greeted with a message unique to the metric.

(Crush Holiday CheerButton) An empty metric bar that slowly increases overtime representing holiday cheer slowly increasing. User presses the button to supress it.
---- If this value reaches 100%, user loses.
*Each button will also have unqiue character animation.*

If the user keeps the Make Money and Donate metrics up and Holiday Cheer down for long enough, the popstar character will transform into Krampus and background will change from snow to flames.

At this point, the user is warned to let in holiday cheer. After transformation, the goal is to let holiday cheer grow to its fullest.


-----------------------
USER STORIES:

As a user, I want to add my name and age to the game.
- want to "ruin the holidays"
- when  my holiday cheer reaches near 0%, a warning is triggered to keep singing.
- the more charity donations I make, the more money I lose in my bank account.
- button 1 will sing and add money to bank account.
- button 2 will play a holiday greeting and add to charity donations.
- button 3 will grumble "bah-humbug", and supress Holiday Cheer.
- want to keep any metrics from reaching the opposite end from which it starts.
- once transformed into Krampus, will want to allow for Holiday Cheer to grow in order to win.
## Wireframes:

## Technologies Used:
    - HTML
    - CSS
    - JavaScript
    - Jquery
    - Ajax(to animate)

## Approach:
Started with the most basic values, such as the three metrics, their corresponding timers, name and age.
Then started figuring out how and how much each would react overtime.

Once most of the functions were in place, some basic HTML was placed to see if things were functioning properly in the browser.

Most of the time was spent debugging things intefering with eachother on the page.

CSS was mostly done last, along with minor tweaks with everything else.

## Challenges:
The bigeest challenge was figuring out how the page/charcter were going to change and getting the metric bars to function properly.

Two outsanding problems is adding a mute button for the audio and add a subtitle to the metric bars without throwing off the whole page.
