"Let's Ruin the Holidays!!!"

## Concept:
Intro page declares "Let's ruin the Holidays!!!" with brief instructions and allows said user to input a name and age.

First page of actual game shows 3 values:
(Make Money Button) A full metric bar that slowly decreases overtime, but increases each time the user pushes the "Make that Money!!! $$$" button. Representing money in bank account.
(Donate to Charity Button) Another full metric bar that slowly decreases overtime, but increases each time user pushes the "Donate to Charity" button. Representing dontations made to charity.
---- If either of these values hits 0, user loses and is greeted with a message unique to the metric.

(Crush Holiday CheerButton) An empty metric bar that slowly increases overtime representing

A charcter is displayed in middle of the screen, depicting Mariah Carey with Santa hat with holiday background (snow, xmas tree, etc.).

3 blank buttons are displayed at the bottom of the screen. 
User is supposed to deduct from how the values are affected which buttons to click.
(Button 1) Character produces high-note sound bite. Adds $50,000 to personal bank account total.
(Button 2) Character produces xmas lyric sound bite. Adds $10,000 to personal bank account and adds 5% to holiday cheer.
(Button 3) Character produces random singing sound bite. Adds $50,000 to charity donations and subtracts $50,000 from personal bank account.
*Each button will also have unqiue character animation.*

The user loses once the personal bank account reaches $0.

Ultimate goal of the game is to reach $2,000,000 in personal bank account.

Once the bank account reaches $1,000,000, the page shows nothing but fire, then transitions into a new page where the values continue.

The character is now Krampus. The background is now just fire.

Buttons maintain same functionality. Once the bank account reaches $2,000,000, user wins the game. Page displays "Happy Holidays!" with fire in background.
