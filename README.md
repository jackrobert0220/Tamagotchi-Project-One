# ApplicationName
Tamagotchi Project One
"The Holidays are Here!"

## Concept:
Explain the concept of the application or game. Include instructions and how to win/lose.
Intro page declares "The Holidays are Here!!!" and allows user to input a name and age.

First page of actual game shows 3 values:
(Personal Bank Account) starts with $500,000 and decreases in increments of 
50,000 slowly with time.
(Holiday Cheer) starts with 5% and decreases by 5% slowly with time. Hitting 0% will do nothing.
(Charity Donations) starts with $50,000 and decreases in increments of 10,000 slowly with time.

A charcteris displayed in middle of the screen, depicting Mariah Carey with Santa hat with holiday background (snow, xmas tree, etc.).

3 blank buttons are displayed at the bottom of the screen. 
User is supposed to deduct from how the values are affected which buttons to click.
(Button 1) Character produces high-note sound bite. Adds $50,000 to personal bank account total.
(Button 2) Character produces xmas lyric sound bite. Adds $10,000 to personal bank account and adds 5% to holiday cheer.
(Button 3) Character produces random singing sound bite. Adds $50,000 to charity donations and subtracts $50,000 from personal bank account.
*Each button will also have unqiue character animation.*

The user loses once the personal bank account reaches $0.

Ultimate goal of the game is to reach $2,000,000 in personal bank account.

Once the bank account reaches $1,000,000, the page shows nothing but fire, then transitions into a new page where the values continue.

The character is now Krampus. The background is now just fire.

Buttons maintain same functionality. Once the bank account reaches $2,000,000, user wins the game. Page displays "Happy Holidays!" with fire in background.
